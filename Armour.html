             <br>
             <p>Shivaji Maharaj is often depicted wearing a distinctive helmet known as a morion.
                 This type of helmet typically had a crest or a comb running from front to back. It provided protection to the head during battles.</p>
                 <p>Shivaji Maharaj's helmet, the Morion, is more than just a piece of armor; it is a symbol of his leadership,
                     cultural pride, and the Maratha spirit of resistance. Its design reflects a blend of practicality and aesthetics,
                      tailored to the needs of a warrior king who led his people with valor and strategic brilliance. </p>

            <p><b> 2.Chain Mail (Kavach)</b></p><br>
            <p>Shivaji Maharaj, renowned for his military acumen and leadership
                , paid meticulous attention to the design and functionality of his armor. One of the key components of his armor was 
                the chain mail, known as "Kavach." This protective gear played a crucial role in safeguarding him during battles and skirmishes. </p>
             <p>chain mail was primarily made from high-quality iron or steel rings. These metals were chosen for their durability and ability to withstand the impact of weapons.</p>
             <p>he chain mail was constructed from thousands of small, interlocking metal rings. Each ring was meticulously riveted to ensure that the armor provided maximum flexibility and protection.</p>
             <p>The weight of the chain mail was distributed evenly across the body to minimize fatigue. Despite being heavy, the design allowed for relatively free movement, crucial for Shivaji's guerrilla warfare tactics.</p>
             <p>The Kavach symbolized the warrior ethos of Shivaji Maharaj and his commitment to protecting his people and kingdom. It was a testament to his readiness to face danger and lead from the front.
            </p>
            <p>The Kavach drew from the rich tradition of armor-making in the Deccan region. Indian armors were known for their intricate designs and the balance between protection and mobility.</p>
            <p>Shivaji Maharaj's chain mail (Kavach) was a crucial element of his military attire, embodying the balance between protection and agility essential for his warfare strategies. Its design and craftsmanship reflect the rich martial traditions of the Deccan region and the innovative spirit of Shivaji's military leadership. The Kavach remains a powerful symbol of Shivaji Maharaj's enduring legacy as a warrior, leader, and protector of his people.

            <p>The gauntlets were typically made from high-quality steel or iron, sometimes adorned with brass or other metals for decoration and additional strength.They consisted of multiple interlocking plates or were crafted from a single piece of metal, offering 
                flexibility while covering the forearm and sometimes extending to the hands and fingers.</p>
