                <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born on February 19, 1630, in the Shivneri Fort,
                    which is located in the Junnar region of Pune district in Maharashtra, India. <br>
                    Born: February 19, 1630, at Shivneri Fort, near Pune, Maharashtra, India <br>
                    Parents: Shahaji Bhosale (father) and Jijabai (mother)
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Jijabai was deeply religious and imparted to Shivaji a strong sense of duty, justice, 
                    and pride in his Hindu heritage. She told him stories of the great Hindu epics, 
                    the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, and about legendary Indian kings, which inspired 
                    Shivaji to dream of establishing an independent kingdom.</p><br>
                    <p>Though often away on military campaigns, Shahajiâ€™s principles and ambitions
                        for the Maratha people were a guiding force in Shivaji's life. His vision of 
                        a sovereign Maratha state was a significant motivation for Shivaji's future endeavors.</p>
